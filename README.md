# Clinical Trial Data Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of clinical trial data, including patient information, treatments, and adverse reactions.

## Project Overview

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on clinical trial data to understand:
- Patient demographics and characteristics
- Treatment effectiveness and outcomes
- Adverse reactions and safety profiles
- Statistical relationships between variables

## Files Description

- `Clinical Trial.ipynb` - Main Jupyter notebook containing the complete analysis
- `patients (1).csv` - Patient demographic and baseline data
- `treatments (1).csv` - Treatment assignment and protocol information
- `adverse_reactions (1).csv` - Adverse event reporting data
- `treatments_cut (2).csv` - Additional treatment data
- Various PNG files - Generated visualizations and plots

## Visualizations

The analysis includes several key visualizations:
- Adverse reactions analysis (bar plots and box plots)
- BMI distribution by treatment groups
- HbA1c levels analysis
- Treatment effectiveness comparisons

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install required dependencies
3. Open `Clinical Trial.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
